**JENKINS
> Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks relted to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.
> It provides a scalable CI/CD pipeline that are used by many prod-grade companies.

**Terminologies
--> Continuous Integration(CI) : CI is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors  into a single software project. it's a primary "DevOps best practice" allowing devs to ferquently merge code changes into a central repo where builds and test then run. It is a pre-cursor for CD.
--> Continuous Delivery(CD) : CD is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production enviornment after the build stage.
--> Pipleline : A series of steps that build, test & deploy automatically to environments.
--> Controller : The central, coordinating process which stores configuration, loads plugins, and renders the various user interfaces for Jenkins. It is the primary instance of a Jenkins pipeline.
--> Agent : An agent is typically a machine, or container(containerized env), which connects to a Jenkins controller and executes tasks(Jobs) when directed by the controller.
--> Stage : An pipeline is broken down into sections called Stages. Each stage has atleast one "step" - ie, scripts/commands to carry out actionable tasks to be carried out in deployment env inside a Pipeline.
--> plugins : Dependencies of Jenkins server which are used to carry out the diffrent unit test specified in the pipeline.
eg: Docker plugin is used to resolve deployment related test/issues inside the pipeline, while node or npm plugin is used to resolve unit tests of the application during testing inside the CI/CD pipeline before pushing it into deployment.

**Jenkinsfile
It is a declarative approach of setting up a Jenkins pipeline by writing code(in a Jenkinsfile).
